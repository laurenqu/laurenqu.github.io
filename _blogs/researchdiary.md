Read Thickness and Information in Dynamic Matching  Markets. This paper presents a stylized but powerful framework for understanding dynamic matching under network constraints. The central insight is that waiting to thicken the market is valuable only when the planner can identify agents who are about to depart. However, their treatment of urgency abstracts away from agent heterogeneity in match value. In practice, some agents (e.g., hard-to-match types) may be inherently rare or contribute disproportionately to social welfare when matched. If this were taken into account, the optimal matching policy might prioritize rarity or value rather than urgency per se. However, because subjective or heterogeneous valuations are hard to observe or measure, the authors focus on urgency as an objective and tractable criterion.

On the technical side, the authors employ a birth–death process Markov chain to characterize the dynamics of the agent pool size under different algorithms. By identifying the stationary distribution of the pool size process and using mean drift balance (a first-moment balance condition), they derive tight upper and lower bounds on expected loss (i.e., the fraction of unmatched agents). This approach not only yields sharp asymptotic results but also demonstrates strong convergence properties. Their method of bounding steady-state performance via analytical Markov models may be of broader methodological interest, especially in macroeconomic contexts where dynamic systems with arrivals and exits are common.

Overall, the paper offers a clear and elegant demonstration that in many matching environments, waiting is only worthwhile if one can observe who is worth waiting for. Under this limited information, simple local heuristics can be both practical and near-optimal.

Finishing reading Roth 2018. A well-written landscape of market design and marketplace. Also had a discussion with Dingwen, about my own interpretation of “market design.”  I regard the market design as an abstract perspective, about the long-lived human behavior of matching and allocation, rather than concrete technical details. Cournot competition, monopoly pricing and auction are all others'.

Reviewed the equivalence between arbitrage-free pricing and the existence of an equivalent martingale measure (EMM), and deepened my understanding of the stochastic discount factor (SDF) as the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution in consumption. Explores Merton’s portfolio problem and its associated HJB equation. While I can follow the derivations, I still find myself more intuitively at ease with solving representative-agent intertemporal optimization problems, compared to pricing specific derivative contracts under risk-neutral measures. Measure theory is useful anyways.

Started working on the research diary after multiple attempts. "The best time to do research is yesterday", and spending repeated effort in thinking about the necessity of keeping the English research diary on my personal website is just not efficient. I decided to make the best use of this summer and change the language of thinking - I still temp to resonate in my native language instead of finishing the whole process (read, process, output) in English. Look forward to use the research diary as a habit tracker, forcing me to practice the professionalism.

Reading Marketplaces, Markets, and Market Design again today. Reading the abstration of markets, about their birth and death, reminds me the first time that I read Becker's A Treatise of the Family. It's beautiful that we can distill the common characteristics of the countless cases and summarize them into elegant principles.
