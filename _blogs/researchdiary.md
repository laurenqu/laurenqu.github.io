Finishing reading Roth 2018. A well-written landscape of market design and marketplace. Also had a discussion with Dingwen, about my own interpretation of “market design.”  I regard the market design as an abstract perspective, about the long-lived human behavior of matching and allocation, rather than concrete technical details. Cournot competition, monopoly pricing and auction are all others'.

Reviewed the equivalence between arbitrage-free pricing and the existence of an equivalent martingale measure (EMM), and deepened my understanding of the stochastic discount factor (SDF) as the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution in consumption. Explores Merton’s portfolio problem and its associated HJB equation. While I can follow the derivations, I still find myself more intuitively at ease with solving representative-agent intertemporal optimization problems, compared to pricing specific derivative contracts under risk-neutral measures.

Started working on the research diary after multiple attempts. "The best time to do research is yesterday", and spending repeated effort in thinking about the necessity of keeping the English research diary on my personal website is just not efficient. I decided to make the best use of this summer and change the language of thinking - I still temp to resonate in my native language instead of finishing the whole process (read, process, output) in English. Look forward to use the research diary as a habit tracker, forcing me to practice the professionalism.

Reading Marketplaces, Markets, and Market Design again today. Reading the abstration of markets, about their birth and death, reminds me the first time that I read Becker's A Treatise of the Family. It's beautiful that we can distill the common characteristics of the countless cases and summarize them into elegant principles.
