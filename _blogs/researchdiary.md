Finishing reading Roth 2018. Really well-written landscape of market design and marketplace. Also had a discussion with Dingwen, about what I think is market design. I regard the market design as an abstract perspective, about the long-lived human behavior of matching,  rather than concrete one. Cournot competition, monopoly pricing and auction are all others'.

Also dipped my feet into asset pricing. Grasped equivalent martingale method, stochastic discount factor and marginal utility ratio. A little more Merton's model and HJB. Still felt more comfortable solving representative agent maximization problem rather than pricing a derivatives. Maybe I'm too relying on the knowns.

Started working on the research diary after multiple attempts. "The best time to do research is yesterday", and spending repeated effort in thinking about the necessity of keeping the English research diary on my personal website is just not efficient. I decided to make the best use of this summer and change the language of thinking - I still temp to resonate in my native language instead of finishing the whole process (read, process, output) in English. Look forward to use the research diary as a habit tracker, forcing me to practice the professionalism.

Reading Marketplaces, Markets, and Market Design again today. Reading the abstration of markets, about their birth and death, reminds me the first time that I read Becker's A Treatise of the Family. It's beautiful that we can distill the common characteristics of the countless cases and summarize them into elegant principles.
