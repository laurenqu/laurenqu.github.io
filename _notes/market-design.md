# Inefficient Market

> Slonim et al (JEP, 2014) [The Market for Blood](https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.28.2.177)

This paper investigates the market for blood in the world. It finds that GDP is positively correlated with blood donation, 75% higher-income countries depend on 100% volunteers for whole blood needs, and 46% lower-income countries depend on other systems for half of their supply, using 2014 data from WHO. Specifically, the United States relies almost entirely on voluntary donations for whole blood, but the U.S. plasma market has long been dominated by commercial operations. These have made the United States the world’s major supplier of plasma products, meeting the needs of countries that depend on voluntary plasma donations. 

The authors claims that the market for blood is inefficient due to lack of price system. Spikes in blood donation after such disasters result in excess supply, and (given blood’s limited shelf life) this often leads to the destruction of surplus supply. Seasonal supply shortages of blood during winter and around holidays are more common. They establishes a donor registry design, which increased donation during short-ages and increased donor welfare.

> Roth, A. (AER, 2018) [Marketplaces, Markets, and Market Design](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.108.7.1609)

This paper discusses markets and marketplaces, using examples to illustrate the wideused jargons in the profession. From a bottom-up perspective, Roth identifies the common pathologies and structural features that recur across diverse market environments, such as congestion, unraveling, misaligned incentives. Thick markets, though desirable for enabling competition and choice, are often susceptible to unraveling, as participants attempt to preempt rivals through early and sometimes ``exploding'' offers. This dynamic leads to temporal externalities, undermining the very thickness that supports efficient matching. Besides, due to time and physical constraints, congestion may occur, which erodes the very gains that thickness is meant to deliver.

At the same time, the paper insists on the institutional specificity of markets. Markets differ in the timing of entry and exit, the granularity and volatility of supply and demand, and the ethical or legal constraints under which they operate. For instance, the design of kidney exchange platforms reflects the unique constraint that no monetary transfer is permitted, and that compatibility is a multidimensional, non-monetizable feature. In such cases, centralized clearinghouses and carefully engineered algorithms—such as the deferred acceptance or top trading cycles—enable matches that would otherwise be infeasible under decentralized search.
