# Observational Study of Cat Grooming and Behavior

## Introduction

This section presents an observation of two domestic cats during and after a grooming session. **Cat 1** and **Cat 2** are analyzed based on their pre- and post-grooming behavior and posture. <br/><img src='/files/7491729111491_.pic.jpg' width="300">

## Observation of Cat 1

The second image [Figure 1] displays **Cat 1** resting comfortably on the floor, before the grooming session. **Cat 1** shows a calm and relaxed demeanor, indicating satisfaction with its environment.

## Observation of Cat 2

The first image [Figure 1] shows **Cat 2** immediately after a grooming session, with visible fur collected on the floor. The grooming tools are present, and **Cat 2** appears cautious, possibly indicating mild discomfort following the grooming process.

In this image, **Cat 2** exhibits a tense posture, likely due to the grooming activity, which is a common behavior in cats who may find grooming stressful.


## Discussion

One possible hypothesis is that **Cat 2** was groomed twice due to an error made by the operator. As a result, both **Cat 1** and **Cat 2** exhibited different responses to the grooming process. **Cat 2** showed noticeable signs of stress, potentially due to the repeated grooming, whereas **Cat 1** appeared much more relaxed. Further observations are needed to better understand how grooming affects the behavior and well-being of domestic cats, particularly in cases where mistakes occur during the grooming process.

## Conclusion

Both **Cat 1** and **Cat 2** respond differently to grooming, with **Cat 2** showing signs of stress, while **Cat 1** appears much more relaxed. Further observations could provide more insights into how grooming impacts the behavior and well-being of domestic cats.
