This research provides the first causal evidence on the impact of implicit childcare subsidies (longer school days) on marriage dissolution. It examines the effect of access to full-time public schools on divorce rates in Mexico. Using a staggered Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach, the study analyzes the effect of the expansion of full-time schooling (FTS) programs across various municipalities. The findings show that the introduction of FTS in a municipality led to an increase in the divorce rate by 0.021 divorces per 1,000 people two years after the program's implementation. This effect grew over time, reaching 0.105 divorces per 1,000 people seven years after the program's introduction.
