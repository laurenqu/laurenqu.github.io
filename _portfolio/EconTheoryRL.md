# Mechanism Design under Quasi-Linear Preferences
## Characterization of Satisfactory Mechanisms for the Revelation of Preferences for Public Goods, Green, J. and J.-J. Laffont (1977), Econometrica

Proved that Groves Mechanism under monotonic preference and separable utility is the ONLY mechanism that can satisfy incentive compatibility and reaches pareto optimum. Show that well-defined mechanisms which select Pareto optimal outcomes (referred to as satisfactory mechanisms), independently of the question of truthful revelation, are  isomorphic to the mechanisms proposed by Groves (solution sets are the same solution to the same equation).

Reduced form links bidder's type to probability of winning in the gamble, ignoring the details of the auction (order, bid, etc). 

Direct form: strategy of bidders. Full form: bid + deciding rule + payment. 

## Border, K. (2007): “Reduced Form Auctions Revisited,” Economic Theory 31(1), 167-181.

Reduced form needs to satisfy the Maskin-Riley-Matthews-Border (MRM) condition. 

total expected allocation weight (or winning probability) across all N bidders whose types belong to the subset A <= probability that at least one bidder has a type in A. 

Total winning probability for bidders in A does not exceed the available "allocation capacity" which depends on the likelihood of at least one bidder having a type in A.
This constraint ensures that the auction is feasible and respects the rules of probability and allocation.
