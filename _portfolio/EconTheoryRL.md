# Mechanism Design under Quasi-Linear Preferences
## Characterization of Satisfactory Mechanisms for the Revelation of Preferences for Public Goods, Green, J. and J.-J. Laffont (1977), Econometrica

Proved that Groves Mechanism under monotonic preference and separable utility is the ONLY mechanism that can satisfy incentive compatibility and reaches pareto optimum. Show that well-defined mechanisms which select Pareto optimal outcomes (referred to as satisfactory mechanisms), independently of the question of truthful revelation, are  isomorphic to the mechanisms proposed by Groves (solution sets are the same solution to the same equation).
