    <h1>Observational Study of Cat Grooming and Behavior</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This section presents an observation of two domestic cats during and after a grooming session. <strong>Cat 1</strong> and <strong>Cat 2</strong> are analyzed based on their post-grooming behavior and posture.</p>

    <h2>Observation of Cat 2</h2>
    <p>The first image (Figure 1) shows <strong>Cat 2</strong> immediately after a grooming session, with visible fur collected on the floor. The grooming tools are present, and <strong>Cat 2</strong> appears cautious, possibly indicating mild discomfort following the grooming process.</p>

    <p><em>Figure 1: Cat 2 after a grooming session, with visible fur and tools.</em></p>
    <p>In this image, <strong>Cat 2</strong> exhibits a tense posture, likely due to the grooming activity, which is a common behavior in cats who may find grooming stressful.</p>

    <h2>Observation of Cat 1</h2>
    <p>The second image (Figure 2) displays <strong>Cat 1</strong> resting comfortably on the floor. <strong>Cat 1</strong> shows a calm and relaxed demeanor, indicating satisfaction with its environment.</p>

    <p><strong>Cat 1</strong>â€™s body language reflects a state of relaxation, suggesting that it has recovered well from the grooming process and feels at ease.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Both <strong>Cat 1</strong> and <strong>Cat 2</strong> respond differently to grooming, with <strong>Cat 2</strong> showing signs of stress, while <strong>Cat 1</strong> appears much more relaxed. Further observations could provide more insights into how grooming impacts the behavior and well-being of domestic cats.</p>
