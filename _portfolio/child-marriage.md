This paper develops a signaling model to explain why early marriage might happen even when there is no inherent preference for young brides. It assumes that early marriage is desirable because being unmarried at a later age is a signal of being an undesirable type, and preferred types have a signaling incentive to enter the market early. In equilibrium, the quality of the bride pool is worse at later ages because bride type is sometimes revealed before marriage, leading some nonpreferred types to reenter the market when older. It shows that signaling can therefore lead to an equilibrium in which everyone marries earlier than is optimal, even though everyone (including men) would be weakly better-off if all women delayed. 


> Buchmann et al. (AER, 2023) [A Signal to End Child Marriage: Theory and Experimental Evidence from Bangladesh](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20220720)
> This paper provides empirical evidence by introduced a conditional incentive program that offered regular transfers to families in Bangladesh of adolescent girls between the ages of 15 and 17 as long as they remained unmarried, for up to 2 years or until they reached the age of consent (18). 

Girls eligible for two years of incentive are 19 percent less likely to marry underage, comparing the to the traditional empowerment program that fails to decrease child marriage. Importantly, the delay in marriage resulting from the incentive did not lead to an increase in dowry or a decrease in spouse quality, which is regarded as a indicator of no marriage market penalty for delaying by the authors. 
Similar to Wahhaj (2018), the model assumes age acts as a negative signal of bride quality, but for a very different reason: because preferred types (conservative) have lower returns to education and hence gain less from delaying marriage. This rationale also provides explanation of why schooling opportunities and adolescent empowerment programs are less effective, but conditional financial incentive succeed in delay marriage by disrupting the signal that drives all types toward younger marriage.
