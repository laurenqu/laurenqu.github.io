# Asset in Marriage

> Lafortune et al (AEJAE, 2023) [Collateralized Marriage](https://doi.org/10.1257/app.20210614)

This paper explains why decline in marriage rate is not universal (highly stratified by homeownership, precisistently high for homeowners/asset holders) by introducing access to a joint savings technology as a collateral of marriage. Although unilateral divorce erodes the commitment of marriage by making divorce easier, and widespread acceptance of nonmarital fertility secures it, joint asset substitutes for the lost contracting security of marriage.

The authors establishe a model in which marriage is with cost $F$ from a random distribution, and value of the house (as a public good) that will be separated 50-50 if a divorce happens. The conclusion is that joint investment protects the lower-earning partner, and hence encourages specialization, investment in public goods and marital stability. Also, the value of marriage increases in wealth with increasing gradient. More generally, the model applies to the problem of public good investment with limited commitment. 

Empirically, families who could not buy the house due to high house price specializes less (men work less, women's time reallocated from home production to work with no change in leisure, women's wage being higher). It also implies inequality and poverty, since limited access to wealth results in lower ability to secure investment, which is inhereited by the next generation.








# Child Marriage

> Wahhaj (JEBO, 2018) [An Economic Model of Early Marriage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268118301562)

This paper develops a signaling model to explain why early marriage might happen even when there is no inherent preference for young brides. It assumes that early marriage is desirable because being unmarried at a later age is a signal of being an undesirable type, and preferred types have a signaling incentive to enter the market early. In equilibrium, the quality of the bride pool is worse at later ages because bride type is sometimes revealed before marriage, leading some nonpreferred types to reenter the market when older. It shows that signaling can therefore lead to an equilibrium in which everyone marries earlier than is optimal, even though everyone (including men) would be weakly better-off if all women delayed. 


> Buchmann et al. (AER, 2023) [A Signal to End Child Marriage: Theory and Experimental Evidence from Bangladesh](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20220720)

This paper provides empirical evidence by introduced a conditional incentive program that offered regular transfers to families in Bangladesh of adolescent girls between the ages of 15 and 17 as long as they remained unmarried, for up to 2 years or until they reached the age of consent (18). 

Girls eligible for two years of incentive are 19 percent less likely to marry underage, comparing the to the traditional empowerment program that fails to decrease child marriage. Importantly, the delay in marriage resulting from the incentive did not lead to an increase in dowry or a decrease in spouse quality, which is regarded as a indicator of no marriage market penalty for delaying by the authors. 

Similar to Wahhaj (2018), the model assumes age acts as a negative signal of bride quality, but for a very different reason: because preferred types (conservative) have lower returns to education and hence gain less from delaying marriage. This rationale also provides explanation of why schooling opportunities and adolescent empowerment programs are less effective, but conditional financial incentive succeeds in delay marriage by disrupting the signal that drives all types toward younger marriage.
