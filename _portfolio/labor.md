# Indivisible Labor

> Rogerson (1988, JME). [Individisible Labor, Lotteries and Equilibrium](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3932(88)90042-6)

This paper explores an economy where labor is indivisible (0 or 1). This assumption introduces a non-convexity into the labor supply decision, which significantly enlarged aggregate fluctuations. Under this setting, optimal allocations involve lotteriesâ€”instead of allowing workers to choose fractional labor supply, the economy randomizes employment across individuals (some workers are employed, while others are not) in a way that preserves efficiency.
