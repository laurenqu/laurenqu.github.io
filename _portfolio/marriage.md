# Asset in Marriage

> Lafortune et al (AEJAE, 2023) [Collateralized Marriage](https://doi.org/10.1257/app.20210614)

This paper explains why decline in marriage rate is not universal (highly stratified by homeownership, precisistently high for homeowners/asset holders) by introducing access to a joint savings technology as a collateral of marriage. Although unilateral divorce erodes the commitment of marriage by making divorce easier, and widespread acceptance of nonmarital fertility secures it, joint asset substitutes for the lost contracting security of marriage.

The authors establishe a model in which marriage is with cost $F$ from a random distribution, and value of the house (as a public good) that will be separated 50-50 if a divorce happens. The conclusion is that joint investment protects the lower-earning partner, and hence encourages specialization, investment in public goods and marital stability. Also, the value of marriage increases in wealth with increasing gradient. More generally, the model applies to the problem of public good investment with limited commitment. 

Empirically, families who could not buy the house due to high house price specializes less (men work less, women's time reallocated from home production to work with no change in leisure, women's wage being higher). It also implies inequality and poverty, since limited access to wealth results in lower ability to secure investment, which is inhereited by the next generation.


# Distribution in Marriage


> Browning & Chiappori (1998, ECMA) [Efficient Intra-Household Allocations: A General Characterization and Empirical Tests](https://doi.org/10.2307/2999616)


This paper is the foundation of a thread of literature that rejects unitary model (claims that household decisions could be analysed as stemming from a unique, well-behaved utility function). It finds that Slutsky symmetry (the fundamental condition for utility maximization) is rejected for a Canadian sample of couples (but holds for samples of singles). However, this does not mean that family may not be maximizing utility, but suggests that the rejection is due to having the wrong model for couples (irrelevant with choice of functional form, goods, or heterogeneity). 

The most important extension is to allow for distribution factors (environmental variables that may influence the decision process), formally defined as variables which do not enter individual utilities directly but that do affect distribution within the household. The collective model implies that there is a close relationship between the influence of such variables on demand and price responses.


> Lundber et al (1997, JHR) [Do Husbands and Wives Pool Their Resources? Evidence from the United Kingdom Child Benefit](https://doi.org/10.2307/146179)

This paper considers the effect of a change in the payment of child benefits in the U.K. in the 1980’s. This change effectively shifted the payment from fathers to mothers without a major impact on household income. In a unitary model, such a shift in “who gets what” should not lead to changes in household decisions (“income pooling”). However, this paper shows that, contrary to the unitary model theory, the policy changes caused significant increases in the demands for children and women’s clothing as compared to men’s clothing.


> Bobonis (JPE, 2009) [Is the Allocation of Resources within the Household Efficient? New Evidence from a Randomized Experiment](https://doi.org/10.1086/600076)

This paper investigates whether whether households make Pareto-efficient intrahousehold resource allocation decisions. By comparing early-entry and late-entry household in Mexico's PROGRESA program, which is a conditional cash transfer program to women in low-income households, and income variation attributable to localized rainfall shocks, the author uses the variables as two distribution factors in a system of household consumption goods demand functions to test these restrictions of the collective model, and the result supports that ratio of distribution factor effects is equal across all public, collective, and individual private goods, which is the evidence of Pareto Efficiency.

Moreover, increases in income specific to female partners have substantial positive effects on expenditure shares in children’s clothing as well as adult female clothing expenditures, while income changes due to rainfall shocks influence expenditures on household public goods to a much lesser extent. It implies that women’s marginal willingness to pay for children’s goods being more sensitive to changes in their decision-making power than that of other decision makers within the household. 




# Child Marriage

> Wahhaj (JEBO, 2018) [An Economic Model of Early Marriage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268118301562)

This paper develops a signaling model to explain why early marriage might happen even when there is no inherent preference for young brides. It assumes that early marriage is desirable because being unmarried at a later age is a signal of being an undesirable type, and preferred types have a signaling incentive to enter the market early. In equilibrium, the quality of the bride pool is worse at later ages because bride type is sometimes revealed before marriage, leading some nonpreferred types to reenter the market when older. It shows that signaling can therefore lead to an equilibrium in which everyone marries earlier than is optimal, even though everyone (including men) would be weakly better-off if all women delayed. 


> Buchmann et al. (AER, 2023) [A Signal to End Child Marriage: Theory and Experimental Evidence from Bangladesh](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20220720)

This paper provides empirical evidence by introduced a conditional incentive program that offered regular transfers to families in Bangladesh of adolescent girls between the ages of 15 and 17 as long as they remained unmarried, for up to 2 years or until they reached the age of consent (18). 

Girls eligible for two years of incentive are 19 percent less likely to marry underage, comparing the to the traditional empowerment program that fails to decrease child marriage. Importantly, the delay in marriage resulting from the incentive did not lead to an increase in dowry or a decrease in spouse quality, which is regarded as a indicator of no marriage market penalty for delaying by the authors. 

Similar to Wahhaj (2018), the model assumes age acts as a negative signal of bride quality, but for a very different reason: because preferred types (conservative) have lower returns to education and hence gain less from delaying marriage. This rationale also provides explanation of why schooling opportunities and adolescent empowerment programs are less effective, but conditional financial incentive succeeds in delay marriage by disrupting the signal that drives all types toward younger marriage.



# Divorce

> Padilla‐Romo et al. (JPubE, 2022) [Parents' Effective Time Endowment and Divorce: Evidence from Extended School Days.](https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/15304/parents-effective-time-endowment-and-divorce-evidence-from-extended-school-days) 

This research provides the first causal evidence on the impact of implicit childcare subsidies (longer school days) on marriage dissolution. It examines the effect of access to full-time public schools on divorce rates in Mexico. Using a staggered DID approach, the study analyzes the effect of the expansion of full-time schooling (FTS) programs across various municipalities. The findings show that the introduction of FTS in a municipality led to an increase in the divorce rate by 0.021 divorces per 1,000 people two years after the program's implementation. This effect grew over time, reaching 0.105 divorces per 1,000 people seven years after the program's introduction.
