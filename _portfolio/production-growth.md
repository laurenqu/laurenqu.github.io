This paper “we argue that differences in the allocation of resources across establishments that differ in productivity may be an important factor in accounting for cross-country differences in output per capita.” ([Restuccia and Rogerson, 2008, p. 707](zotero://select/library/items/SKILDPP2)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YSGQGNRM?page=1&annotation=7N4HLUHD))
