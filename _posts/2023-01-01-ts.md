###  Abstract
In this paper, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and General Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) were used to investigate the cause of the air-pollution episodes. The
data from January 2020 to December 2021 with 17520 observations were utilized in this study and are collected from the Bureau of Weather and Climate of China. The result suggests that unfavorable diffusion conditions (weak surface winds and high
humidity) have induced heavy-haze pollution in the Beijing region over the two
years. In order to examine the effect of emission reduction measures on pollutant
concentrations, we must take into account the confounding effect of meteorological parameters, such as wind speed or air pressure.
