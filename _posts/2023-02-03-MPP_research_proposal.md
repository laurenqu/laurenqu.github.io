### Field of Study and Research Plan 2023mext

　１　Present field of study（現在の専攻分野）
 
I studied microeconomics, macroeconomics and econometrics in my bachelor year at Waseda University. 
1） For microeconomics, I have taken introduction to microeconomics, which built me the foundation of economics, the concept of marginal return, and cost and benefit analysis. Then, I stepped into intermediate microeconomics. The study of monopoly, monopsony and oligopoly introduced more realistic scenarios. By studying edgeworth box and exchange economy, I have been more familiar with the concept of public goods and welfare, the Arrow’s impossible theorem also provided me a chance to reflect the concept of fairness. Finally, I studied advanced microeconomics pricing theory, the arbitrage, Robinson and market economics, and how governmental policy influences the equilibria. I also studied public economics and law and economics, which help me to analyze realistic problem from a theoretical perspective of game theory and backward consideration. 
2） For macroeconomics, my study began from introduction to macroeconomics which introduced the concept of aggregation, and production function of various forms. Then, intermediate macroeconomics talked about multilateral trade and exchange activities among multiple organizations. Public finance gave me the knowledge of fiscal policy and monetary policy and how taxes influence heterogeneous groups differently. 
3） For econometrics, the introduction to econometrics I took talked about ordinary least square estimator, its application, and how to evaluate the accuracy of the estimator. Then, more advanced econometrics class introduced the concepts in time series and Vector autoregression model, generalize the single-variable (univariate) autoregressive model by allowing for multivariate time series, and impulse-response analysis which allowed me to analyze the reaction of variables to a specific input. I also took causal inference and applied econometrics to understand common techniques such as Difference-in-Difference, Instrumental Variable and discontinuity. Besides, I took calculus, linear algebra, mathematical statistics, probability theory and stochastic process to deepen my understanding of the techniques used in econometrics.

research topic: 
how multilateral organizations continue to function in times of acute geopolitical confrontation and distrust between great powers. 
The gravity of the problems threatening the global village was so immense that mutual distrust between global powers is dangerously deepening. Multiple crises, including geopolitical tensions between major Powers, are polarizing and destabilizing the global situation, which significantly squeezes the living space of multilateral organizations. Moreover, confrontation and distrust in the form of tariff competitions and trade wars deteriorate the situation.
On the other hand, the world is falling prey to a new set of military conflicts, which provides space for multilateral organizations to function. Obviously, the return to strategic competition between great Powers and the resulting prospect of a high-intensity armed conflict between them could only lead to the world’s self-destruction, and in fact, despite the seemingly limited living space, multilateral platforms were the pillar and catalysts of peace, for monitoring and regulating disarmament through global solitary, trust and understanding. Furthermore, multilateral organizations may contribute to the peace-building process by creating new demands and seeking new opportunities, to function with new roles among great powers.

Research background: 
The struggle over the control of geographical entities with an international and global dimension, and the use of such geographical entities for political advantage (Colin Flint, Introduction to Geopolitics, 3rd edition. Pg 16; 36-39) has significantly caused panics, nervousness and uneasiness among the globe. One example is the Ukraine crisis, both the deterrence and the Russia’s integration into international economic relations solves the extensive disruption of any interlocking of interests with the Western world, and Russia’s leadership from overrunning the geopolitical issue with Ukraine by means of a war and aggression is clearly illegal under international law. Meanwhile, mistrust between major powers makes it harder for them to coordinate on arms control or ensure the cooperation. Turkey, which could be a jewel in the crown of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), has presented a unique challenge for Beijing. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who has been accused of human rights violations at home, has publicly voiced concerns over China’s treatment of the Uighurs, a Muslim and Turkic minority group. 
  
Research Purpose:
1 To discuss the influence of acute geopolitical confrontation and distrust between great powers on multilateral organizations.
The severity of nervousness among world powers creates an intense atmosphere for multilateral organizations to survive. However, the above mentioned severe situation does not mean that mean that all functions of multilateral organizations are unable to continue. According to de Wijk, Rob, et al. “The Future of Multilateralism.”, Multilateralism’s biggest challenge is to come to terms with global power shifts, zero-sum nationalism, new interstate rivalries.  Therefore, it is important to analyze the influence of changing situation on the multilateral organizations .On the one hand, the roles that multilateral organizations before the acute stress and distrust may still function in the era of geopolitical confrontation and distrust between great powers. prioritizing their mandates and working towards their objectives are always needed regardless of the time because of continuous demand. On the other hand, only by discussing the influence would it be possible to analyze the changing demand of multilateral organizations. Severe situation does not mean that the organizations have no surviving space or are no longer needed. On the contrary, the new situation creates new demand for multilateral organizations that act neutrally among multiple powers. 

2. to discuss new function of multilateral organizations given new demand and situations.
Multilateral organizations may still prioritizing their mandate and focusing on issues that are agreed upon by all parties. They also maintain communication and dialogue between member states to prevent escalation of tensions and strive to resolve conflicts through diplomatic means. Additionally, established rules and norms within the organization, such as decision-making procedures and dispute resolution mechanisms, provide a framework for continued operation even in challenging circumstances. It is important for these organizations to remain impartial and neutral to maintain their credibility and effectiveness. Furthermore, the organizations may benefit from merging and acquisitioning just like marketized firms and companies to function better, or serve as a platform for dialogue and cooperation, and their role in maintaining international peace and stability remains essential.

3. to find other possible methods to enhance the role of multilateral organizations for contributing to the peace-building process.
1) Improving Conflict Prevention and Resolution Mechanisms: Multilateral organizations can improve their conflict resolution and prevention mechanisms in order to respond quickly to potential conflicts before they escalate. This would necessitate greater cooperation among multilateral organizations as well as a higher priority for information sharing.

2) Expanding Collaboration with Civil Society: Multilateral organizations can collaborate more closely with civil society organizations and local communities to address the root causes of conflict and promote long-term peace.

3) Humanitarian Assistance: Multilateral organizations can provide humanitarian assistance to conflict-affected communities, thereby alleviating suffering and fostering trust between conflicting parties.

4) Promoting Economic Cooperation: To reduce tensions and create incentives for peace, multilateral organizations can promote economic cooperation and development in conflict-affected regions.

5) Promoting Good Governance and Democracy: Multilateral organizations can help conflict-affected countries promote good governance and democratic institutions, which can help prevent future conflicts and promote long-term peace. 

6) Improving Transparency and Accountability: To foster trust and confidence in their efforts to promote peace, multilateral organizations can improve transparency and accountability in their operations, particularly in conflict-affected areas.

（研究計画：詳細かつ具体に記入し、特に研究の最終目標について具体的に記入すること。）
The ultimate goal of research on how multilateral organizations function in times of acute geopolitical confrontation and distrust between great powers is to better understand and promote these organizations' role in maintaining international peace and security. The study's goal is to identify strategies and best practices for ensuring that multilateral organizations remain effective and relevant in the face of rising geopolitical tensions. The research may also shed light on how to strengthen the role of multilateral organizations in preventing conflict, promoting stability, and fostering inter-state cooperation. The ultimate goal of this research is to contribute to a more peaceful and stable world by strengthening multilateral organizations' capacity to address global challenges and advance collective solutions to international problems.

Research Subject: 
It involves analyzing the role and impact of multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, World Health Organization, and others, in maintaining stability and preventing conflict in a world characterized by growing geopolitical tensions and distrust between great powers. The research may focus on various aspects of multilateral organizations, including their governance structures, decision-making processes, and impact on peace-building efforts. The subject also includes an examination of the challenges faced by multilateral organizations in functioning effectively in times of acute geopolitical confrontation, and the strategies and approaches that have been successful in overcoming these challenges.

Research Method: 
1）	Historical analysis: This method involves examining the history of multilateral organizations and their role in addressing geopolitical confrontation and distrust between great powers. This can help to identify trends and patterns in the functioning of these organizations over time and shed light on the factors that have contributed to their success or failure.

2）	Case studies: Case studies are in-depth analyses of specific instances of multilateral organizations operating in the context of acute geopolitical confrontation and distrust. These studies can provide detailed insights into the challenges faced by these organizations, as well as the strategies and approaches that have been successful in overcoming these challenges.

3）	Comparative analysis: This method involves comparing the functioning of different multilateral organizations in similar geopolitical contexts. This can help to identify common patterns and trends, as well as best practices for ensuring the continued effectiveness of these organizations in the face of acute geopolitical confrontation and distrust.

4）	Surveys and interviews: Surveys and interviews can be used to gather data and perspectives from experts, practitioners, and decision-makers involved in the functioning of multilateral organizations. This information can be used to provide a more nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing these organizations.

5）	Quantitative analysis: Quantitative analysis involves using statistical methods to analyze data on the functioning of multilateral organizations. This can help to identify trends and patterns in the data, as well as test hypotheses about the factors that contribute to the effectiveness of these organizations in times of acute geopolitical confrontation and distrust.

The choice of research method will depend on the specific research question, data availability, and the goals of the study. A combination of these methods may be used to provide a comprehensive understanding of the subject.

The relationship between studied contents and the research:
Economic analysis can play an important role in understanding how multilateral organizations continue to function in times of acute geopolitical confrontation and distrust between great powers. Some ways in which economics knowledge can be used to analyze this subject include:

1）	Game theory: Game theory can be used to model and analyze the strategic interactions between states and multilateral organizations in times of acute geopolitical confrontation and distrust. This can help to understand the incentives and motives behind state behavior and the role of multilateral organizations in shaping these incentives.

2）	Cost-benefit analysis: Cost-benefit analysis can be used to evaluate the benefits and costs of participation in multilateral organizations for individual states. This can help to understand the trade-offs faced by states in choosing whether to participate in these organizations, and the impact of geopolitical confrontation and distrust on these trade-offs.

3）	Public goods analysis: Multilateral organizations are often viewed as public goods, meaning that their benefits are shared by all members and non-members, and that their costs are borne by the members. Public goods analysis can be used to understand the incentives for states to contribute to multilateral organizations and the impact of geopolitical confrontation and distrust on these incentives.

4）	International trade and investment analysis: Multilateral organizations play a crucial role in shaping the international trade and investment environment. Economic analysis can be used to understand the impact of geopolitical confrontation and distrust on international trade and investment flows, and the role of multilateral organizations in mitigating these impacts.

5）	Development economics: Multilateral organizations often play a key role in promoting development and reducing poverty. Development economics can be used to understand the impact of geopolitical confrontation and distrust on economic development, and the role of multilateral organizations in addressing these challenges.

6）	Data analysis: with econometrics knowledge, using panel data would help to investigate exactly when do the function of multilateral organization begin to depreciate. Furthermore, the techniques are useful in quantitatively analyzing how the multilateral organizations may contribute to the existing dilemmas and crisis. 

These are some of the ways in which economics knowledge can be used to analyze the functioning of multilateral organizations in times of acute geopolitical confrontation and distrust between great powers. This analysis can help to better understand the economic incentives and motives behind state behavior and the role of multilateral organizations in shaping these incentives.
