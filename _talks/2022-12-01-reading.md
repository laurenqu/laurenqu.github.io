# to learn how to avoid being deceived by the economists

## PROMISES AND PARTNERSHIP 2021.11.18
Charness, G., & Dufwenberg, M. (2006). Promises and Partnership. Econometrica, 74(6), 1579–1601. http://www.jstor.org/stable/4123084

This paper aims at researching the impact of communication on motivation and behavior. The researchers designed a one-shot principal–agent trust game with hidden action, in which the agent is free to exert less effort due to unobservable effort to the principal. Then, the concept of guilt aversion is introduced, a guilt-averse player suffers from guilt to the extent he believes he hurts others relative to what they believe they will get, and the sensitivity of guilt are measured by asking players to guess the payoff of the counterpart. The main guilt-aversion hypothesis of the paper is that, exert effort is more common in message treatment and coinside with higher “guesses”. 
Results show a strong correlation between B’s second-order beliefs and behavior, the likelihood of both parties to exert effort, which is in accordance with guilt aversion hypothesis and contrary to the null hypothesis of no relationship between B’s beliefs and behavior, as supposed by the cheap talk theory. Besides the success in predicting the outcome in this game, guilt aversion is also more generally adaptable than fixed cost of lying in explaining selfless choice in scenarios that lying do not occur, or decision makers do not suffer if they lie. 
The conclusion, promises (or statements of intent) sent from agents to principals enhance trust, cooperation, and efficiency, seems common. However, the paper did not clearly distinguish between guilt aversion and moral expectation. That is, to avoid harming others, and to do what is expected to do. There may exist some causal relationship or interconnection between the two. Also, manipulating guilt aversion for certain purposes is possible in this game and worth researching.



## A Treatise on the Family 2022.12.10

* chapter 2

purposes of families: to ensure comparative advantage (“determined partly by biological differences and partly by different experiences and different investments in human capital.”) ([Becker, 1991, p. 30]
is made to its fullest

effects: two n-people family goes to a 2n-people family for the benefits from labor division and “Specialization in the allocation of time and in the accumulation of human capital” ([Becker, 1991, p. 30]

upper bond:“Shirking of duties, pilfering, and cheating is made easier by the extensive specialization and division of labor within families.” 
privacy as good, constraints the unlimited expansion of family, that not all the n's will combine to be 2n's. 

why marriage exists:“Since married women have been specialized to childbearing and other domestic activities, they have demanded long-term "contracts" from their husbands to protect them against abandonment and other adversities.” ([Becker, 1991, p. 30]

“"marriage" is defined by a long-term commitment between aman and awoman.” ([Becker, 1991, p. 31]) 

* chapter 3

“increased participation of married women: “increased earning power as Western, economies developed”  ,  “rapid expansion of the service sector” 

divorce:“The gain from marriage is reduced, and hence the attractiveness of divorce is raised”  , “sexual division of labor within households becomes less advantageous” 

female are less produtive because housework is energy-intensive while other work are time-intensive

why theres no polygamy in the modern days
1. culture and religion
2. law
3. demand of children has changed
    

“Gr~ups opposing polygyny claim to be opposed to the degradation and exploitation of women.22 My analySIS of efficient, competitive marriage markets indicates, however, that the income of women and the competition by men for wives would be greater when polygyny is greater ifthe incidence of polygyny had been determined mainly by the relative marginal contribution of women to output.” ([Becker, 1991, p. 98]

polygyny is more common than polyandry because marginal contribution and child preference. biological intrinsic of gender
