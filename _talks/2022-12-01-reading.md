# to learn how to avoid being deceived by the economists

## PROMISES AND PARTNERSHIP 2021.11.18
[Charness, G., & Dufwenberg, M. (2006). Promises and Partnership. Econometrica, 74(6), 1579–1601.](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4123084)

This paper aims at researching the impact of communication on motivation and behavior. The researchers designed a one-shot principal–agent trust game with hidden action, in which the agent is free to exert less effort due to unobservable effort to the principal. Then, the concept of guilt aversion is introduced, a guilt-averse player suffers from guilt to the extent he believes he hurts others relative to what they believe they will get, and the sensitivity of guilt are measured by asking players to guess the payoff of the counterpart. The main guilt-aversion hypothesis of the paper is that, exert effort is more common in message treatment and coinside with higher “guesses”. 

Results show a strong correlation between B’s second-order beliefs and behavior, the likelihood of both parties to exert effort, which is in accordance with guilt aversion hypothesis and contrary to the null hypothesis of no relationship between B’s beliefs and behavior, as supposed by the cheap talk theory. Besides the success in predicting the outcome in this game, guilt aversion is also more generally adaptable than fixed cost of lying in explaining selfless choice in scenarios that lying do not occur, or decision makers do not suffer if they lie. 

The conclusion, promises (or statements of intent) sent from agents to principals enhance trust, cooperation, and efficiency, seems common. However, the paper did not clearly distinguish between guilt aversion and moral expectation. That is, to avoid harming others, and to do what is expected to do. There may exist some causal relationship or interconnection between the two. Also, manipulating guilt aversion for certain purposes is possible in this game and worth researching.


## The Impact of Divorce Laws on Marriage-Specific Capital 2022.12.11
[Betsey Stevenson. (2006). The impact of divorce laws on marriage-specific capital. Working Paper Series 2006-43, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.](https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fedfwp/2006-43.html)

The paper examines investment decisions of couples in their first 2 years of marriage using 1970 and 1980 censuses of the US, takes states that change their divorce laws as treatment group with those in states that do not as control group, and compares changes in the behavior (female labor force participation, full-time labor market work by both spouses, supporting a spouse’s investment in education, children, and home ownership) of newlyweds.

Based on the trend of adopting unilateral divorce, this paper argues that influences of decreased divorce cost on decreasing incentive to invest in marriage-specific capital is fourfold. Firstly, with higher divorce rate, spouses benefit less from marriage-specific capital, reducing the incentive to invest jointly. Secondly, changes in divorce laws are followed by changes in bargaining power and likely by changes in marital investment decision. Thirdly, divorce laws can shape the ability to commit to the distribution of future investment payoff. Fourthly, to strategically go against divorce law changes, it is possible to overinvest today to constrain future selves to prefer to remain married than to divorce. On the other hand, unilateral divorce laws may increase the incentive to invest as a precommit to not divorcing, which should lead to increasing symmetric investment that increases the value of marriage in future, with little effet on asymmetric, intertemporal investments.

Results show that comparing to the treatment group, the control group is 10% less likely to be supporting a spouse through school, 8% more likely to have both spouses employed in the labor force full time and are 5% more likely to have a wife in the labor force. Finally, they are about 6% less likely to have a child. The exception is home ownership, where the removal of fault in property settlements appears to encourage home ownership in the early years of a marriage.

## A Treatise on the Family 2022.12.10

* chapter 2
This chapter discusses the fundamental reason of marriage and the benefits, as well as the limitation on the size of the family. 

Firstly, the purpose of the family is to ensure comparative advantage is made to its fullest, which is “determined partly by biological differences and partly by different experiences and different investments in human capital [Becker, 1991, p. 30].” Even when there is no obvious comparative advantage, if there is differnt initial endowment, and "if commodity production functions have constant or increasing returns to scale, all members of efficient households would specialize completely in the market or household sectors and would invest only in market or household capital [Becker, 1991, p. 35]". Terefore, Labor division will lead to two n-person household form a single 2n-person union for the benefits from labor division and specialization in the allocation of time and in the accumulation of human capital. 

However, the merging is not endless, because people still value privacy and fairness of labor division. Therefore, the upper bond is created by dishonesty and shrinking or cheating of duties, which increases with the specialization and division of labor within families. Here, privacy is regarded as a goods whose marginal utility is positive, then its price is the marginal benefit of expansion. It constraints the unlimited expansion of family to the equilibrium, with the optimal degree of specialization and privacy determined. This restricts the size of family and not all the n's will combine to be 2n's.  (privacy as agood is discussed in Posner, 1979)

Finally, this chapter defines marriage as a a long-term commitment between a man and a woman: “Since married women have been specialized to childbearing and other domestic activities, they have demanded long-term "contracts" from their husbands to protect them against abandonment and other adversities ([Becker, 1991, p. 50].”
