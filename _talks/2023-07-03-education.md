Education policies
Total resource policies increase the total amount of funding to a school or to individuals making education decisions. (eg:  increasing the total amount of funding available to schools; giving money to parents or students)


2. Input-based policies are targeted at specific inputs to the education process, such as class sizes, teachers, or the offering of certain educational programs. (eg: These policies can work through government mandates (such as smaller classes), or they can work by explicitly altering prices through subsidies and taxes. For example, the government could provide a subsidy for every highly qualified teacher hired by a school)

3. Output-based policies alter the incentives schools, teachers, and students face, with the objective or promoting certain educational outcomes. (alter the incentives faced by individuals and schools. School choice policies increase competition for students by allowing them to choose which local school to attend without forcing their parents to move. Another example is teacher merit pay (or incentive pay), which ties teacher compensation directly to measured education outcomes.)
