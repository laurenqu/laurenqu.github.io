This research investigates how changes in housing prices influence divorce rates, using a policy shift in China as a natural experiment. The study employs a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) based on a 2010 policy that reduced taxes and down payments for small housing units (≤ 90m²). Results indicate that the policy indirectly affected divorce rates through its impact on housing prices. Although the policy increased housing wealth, it introduced new dynamics in marital stability. The analysis suggests that macroeconomic conditions, such as housing prices, play a significant role in marital decisions.[Proposal](https://laurenqu.github.io/files/HousingPriceFamilyStability_0910.pdf) [Proposal Slides](https://laurenqu.github.io/files/HousingMarriage-lauren.pdf)
