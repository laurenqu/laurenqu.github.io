This research explores the trade-offs between internships and education in the context of the Ben-Porath human capital model. It examines how individuals allocate their time to accumulate both general and industry-specific human capital to maximize their lifetime earnings. Internships offer industry-specific experience, while education provides general knowledge. The study also highlights how different industries value these two types of human capital, and how individuals optimize their time investment based on wage rates, costs of education and internships, and the productivity of each. By understanding this balance, the research aims to shed light on the decision-making processes of individuals as they navigate schooling and internships, contributing to broader discussions on labor market outcomes and human capital accumulation.
